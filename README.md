### Book Recommendation System

1. First, we create a notebook/ folder, and inside it, a research notebook (research.ipynb) to conduct all the exploratory work. In this notebook, we build our collaborative filtering model and save the trained model using pickle into an artifacts/ folder.

2. Next, we set up the project folder structure to enable modular and maintainable coding. This can be done either manually or automatically. Here, we create the structure automatically.

- We create a template.py file, which contains the logic to generate the projectâ€™s folder structure.

- This template.py file can be reused for any end-to-end machine learning project. You can also customize it based on specific project requirements.

- It includes everything needed to set up a standard ML pipeline structure, ensuring consistency across projects.

3. Modular Coding Approach:
Instead of writing all code in a single file, we split the logic into separate modules (e.g., data ingestion, model training, evaluation, etc.), and bring them together at the main execution point.
